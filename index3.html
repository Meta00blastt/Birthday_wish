        <p>I really love everything about you. Your personality is quite unique, you are warm in nature like you really get mixed up with different people easily. You are not just a wonderful person; you are an incredible friend, and you have a great leadership inside you. I don't know what you think about yourself but that's what I saw in you and I really did admire those things. I often find myself a bit cold and shy, caught in a whirlwind of wanting to connect yet also don't want to. Itâ€™s confusing, but witnessing your vibrant spirit and the amazing circle of friends you've built has motivated me to seek change within myself.</p>
        
        <p>Soo as I'am going to move on, won't ever disturb you and will stop making this cringe website.I am glad that I met you in person. Your mom's handmade prawn curry really saved me some days. Well won't lie but I don't think we will able to meet again. Soo take care and thankyou for reading all the way down till here.</p>
